# chance-proxy

> A tiny reverse proxy that disconnects users by chance.

## Building

To build chance-proxy, you will need:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com)
- [Go](https://go.dev) 1.22 or later

After ensuring you have installed all of the prerequisites, run the following commands to build chance-proxy:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/interrrp/chance-proxy
cd chance-proxy
go build -ldflags "-s -w" -o chance-proxy .
```

The executable will now be in the `chance-proxy` directory. Good job! üòÄüëç

## Configuration

All configuration happens through passing command-line arguments:

```text
-address string
    Address to listen on (default "localhost:8081")
-chance int
    Chance of failure (default 20)
-target string
    Target address (default "localhost:8080")
```

### Examples

Listen on `localhost:25566` and proxy to `localhost:25565`

```sh
chance-proxy -address localhost:25566 -target localhost:25565
```

Fail 90% of the time:

```sh
chance-proxy -chance 90
```
